I am Steffy Ranjith, currently in my third year of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Mahindra University. I consider myself an approachable, determined, and dedicated individual with a strong "never give up" attitude.

My primary interests lie in UI/UX design and frontend development. However, given the increasing demand for backend development, machine learning, and data science in today's industry, I am actively working on expanding my knowledge in these domains to stay at the forefront of technological advancements.

The ever-evolving IT industry offers immense opportunities, which is why I chose Computer Science as my field of study. Over time, I have deepened my interest in this domain, working on projects related to AI, ML, and frontend development.

I was awarded a merit scholarship for both my first and second years, which has been a great motivation for continuous learning. Last summer, I interned at WWIC in Lagos, Nigeria, where I contributed to a web fleet management project. This experience significantly enhanced my understanding of backend development and database integration.

With strong collaboration, leadership, and problem-solving skills, I thrive in team environments and am committed to delivering impactful work. An opportunity at your esteemed organization would greatly contribute to my personal and professional growth. I assure you that my contributions will be valuable to the companyâ€™s success.
